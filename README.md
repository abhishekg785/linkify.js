linkify
=======

A simple node module to convert the url-strings (having http://, https:// , www., or ftp:// ) into the html clickable links.

For eg : As string like => this is the link to my git profile https://github.com/abhishekg785/ will be converted simply into

<code>
  <a href = 'https://github.com/abhishekg785/'>https://github.com/abhishekg785/</a>
</code>
